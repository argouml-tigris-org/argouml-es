      <title>Installing Auxiliary Modules (Not yet translated to Spanish)</title>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      The standard installation of ArgoUML does not support C++, php and C# code
      generation. To make this possible, you need to download the 
      <literal>auxiliary modules</literal> 
      from the download page at the ArgoUML website.

      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      The result should be that the directory that contains the
      <filename>argouml.jar</filename> file, now also contains a subdirectory

      <para>To be translated to Spanish: You will see the instructions:</para>
      
      <programlisting><![CDATA[
Usage: [options] [project-file]
Options include:
  -help           display this information
  -big            use big fonts
  -huge           use huge fonts
  -nosplash       don't display logo at startup
  -noedem         don't report usage statistics
  -nopreload      don't preload common classes
  -norecentfile   don't reload last saved file
  -command <arg>  command to perform on startup
  -batch          don't start GUI
  -locale <arg>   set the locale (e.g. 'en_GB')
  -open <arg>     open given file on startup
  -print <arg>    print given file on startup (and exit)

You can also set java settings which influence the behaviour of ArgoUML:
  -Xms250M -Xmx500M  [makes ArgoUML reserve more memory for large projects]]]>
    </programlisting>
      
      <para>To be translated to Spanish:  A common problem is that the User Interface is shown in the wrong language. 
	  Below is an easy way to switch back to the English UI. 
	  Please beware: the language is in lowercase.
</para>
      
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: <command>java -jar argouml.jar -locale en</command>
</para>
      
      <para>To be translated to Spanish:  ArgoUML may be run without UI, in batch mode. 
	  Currently the possibilities are very limited. 
	  Below is an example (everything on 1 line!): 
	  It reads a "test.zargo" from my working directory, 
	  gets the diagram named "A", 
	  and writes a PNG graphical file for this diagram. 
	  Without the "-batch", 
	  ArgoUML would start up the UI after executing the commands. 
</para>
      
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: <command>java -jar argouml.jar -batch -command "org.argouml.uml.ui.ActionOpenProject=c:\Documents and Settings\Michiel\My Documents\test.zargo" -command org.argouml.ui.cmd.ActionGotoDiagram=A -command "org.argouml.uml.ui.ActionSaveGraphics=c:\Documents and Settings\Michiel\My Documents\test.PNG"</command>

      </sect1info>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
This works only if you have installed using the binary distribution.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
First, find a Zargo file, and right-click on it.
You should get the normal Windows menu, including an Open or Open With option.
At this point, give a description for the file like "ArgoUML Model", 
and tell Windows to use Notepad to open the file.
That's not what you want to do ultimately, but it does get Windows to
accept the .zargo extension as representing a valid file type.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
Now, open Windows Explorer and from the menu select View->Options 
(or on Windows XP: Tools->Folder Options...). 
You
should get a two (or more) tabbed dialog. Click the "File Types" dialog, and
then scroll through the list for the Description you gave - in the example
"ArgoUML Model". Click to select that file type, and then click the "Edit"
button.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
Now, click on the "Open" action and then the "Edit" button there. You will
then get a dialog that has a line for entering in the application action
which will have a line for using Notepad to open the file. Replace that line
with:
<command>
"C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.0_01\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "c:\ArgoUML\argouml.jar" "%L"
</command>
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
Substitute your path to your <filename>javaw.exe</filename> and 
<filename>argouml.jar</filename> files if they are 
in a different location.
Click OK, then click OK, then click OK (three buttons on
three different levels of the dialog).
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: The %L in the above commandline is needed instead of %1 
because that is the way to
support filename extensions of more than 3 characters.

    <title>ArgoUML Principles (Not yet translated to Spanish)</title>
    <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
    When ArgoUML starts, then it shows an empty class diagram
    on which you can add various objects. ArgoUML works according the following
    principles:
</para>
    
    <section>
      <title>Project, Model and Diagram (Not yet translated to Spanish)</title>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      The file operations save and open handle one 
      <literal>project</literal> at a
      time. One <literal>project</literal> corresponds to a
      <literal>model</literal> plus diagram information, 
      i.e. everything you can edit within the ArgoUML window. 
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      The <literal>model</literal> may contain many
      objects (ModelElements) which
      form the complete UML description 
      of the system you are describing.
      All ModelElements might be present on a diagram, 
      but this is not required. 
      Hence, the <literal>model</literal> 
      that is stored in ArgoUML is
      independent of the contents of the diagrams. 
      This may be explained by the possibility 
      to generate programming code from the 
      <literal>model</literal> - you 
      do not need any diagrams for this.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      A ArgoUML <literal>project</literal> also contains 
      all diagram information, i.e.
      the shapes (presentation) used 
      to represent the various UML ModelElements, 
      their location, color, etc. 
      Some ModelElements appear on multiple diagrams, 
      some on one or none.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      Hence, saving and opening projects 
      retains all this information. 
      There is a way to only save the 
      <literal>model</literal> information
      though, which is by the menu 
      "Tools" -> "Export as XMI...". 
      This may be usefull e.g. 
      when generating programming code 
      with an external tool 
      that understands XMI.
</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Objects (Not yet translated to Spanish)</title>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      Select objects by left-clicking on them.
      The functionality of ArgoUML can be activated in the menu, 
      in toolbars,
      or in pop-up menus when right-clicking above an object.
      Many of these functions work on the selected objects.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      All diagrams have toolbars at the top which are used 
      to create objects on the diagram.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      Most objects can be added to a diagram and removed from a diagram without
      deleting it from the <literal>model</literal>! 
      Select an object on a diagram, and then the menu item 
      "Edit" -> "Remove from Diagram" clears the object from the diagram, 
      but the object remains intact in the model, 
      which may be seen in the explorer, 
      i.e. the tree structure at the left hand side.
      Once removed, and item can be added back to the diagram 
      (or any other diagram for that matter)
      by selecting it in the explorer 
      and selecting the item "Add to Diagram" 
      in the right-click pop-up menu.
</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Overview of the window (Not yet translated to Spanish)</title>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      The top of the window contains a menu bar with commands available.
      In the <literal>File</literal> menu you can store the project or 
      open another project instead.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      The upper left part of the ArgoUML window shows a tree model 
      of diagrams and objects. 
      This view can be adapted to your needs 
      by filtering the objects that are shown, 
      and the structure in which they are shown.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      The upper right part of ArgoUML shows the current diagram (one at a time).
      You can drag and drop the objects in the diagrams,
      and you can use the quick-links 
      that appear when hovering over a selected object 
      to create new objects connected to the
      already present objects.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      The lower right part contains various details of the currently selected 
      object: You select the object in one of the upper
      levels and choose what details you want to examine using the
      tabs.
</para>
      <para>To be translated to Spanish: 
      The lower left part contains a list of all ToDo items for this
      model.
